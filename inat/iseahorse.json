Project Seahorse scientists will then use this vital information to map data-deficient seahorse populations, determine their threat levels, and develop effective conservation actions. \r\n \r\nWe know that seahorses face significant threats to their survival as a species. Unfortunately, we don’t know the true extent to which they are threatened. iSeahorse will allow more data to be gathered to study seahorses in the wild, which is often difficult due to their ability to blend, chameleon-like, into the seagrass beds, coral reefs, and other coastal marine habitats they call home. \r\n \r\nBy sharing results, we can all work to regulate the seahorse trade, develop marine protected areas, and engage more people in ocean conservation.\r\n \r\nThe beta version of iSeahorse launched in October 2012. A public launch is planned for the fall of 2013, with iPhone and Android apps to follow later in the year.","featured_at":null,"icon_content_type":"image/jpeg","icon_file_name":"PSLogo.jpg","icon_file_size":7298,"icon_updated_at":"2013-05-21T12:55:31-07:00","id":871,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"map_type":"terrain","observed_taxa_count":2,"place_id":null,"project_type":"","slug":"iseahorse","source_url":"","terms":"By using iSeahorse, you agree to the terms of this Privacy and Use Agreement. iSeahorse is provided by Project Seahorse, a research unit of The University of British Columbia, Canada, which together are hereafter referred to as 'Project Seahorse', 'we', or 'us'.\r\n\r\nSubmitting Information\r\n\r\nSeahorse observations\r\n\r\nBy submitting your seahorse observations (“Observations”) to iSeahorse, you are making them available to Project Seahorse for research, education, conservation, and management purposes.\r\n\r\nYour Observations remain yours and you are free to make this information available to others.
