This project is aimed at creating a shared library that can be used to integrate iNaturalist.org with multiple platforms. The primary targets at the moment are Drupal and Wordpress. This project makes use of the iNaturalist API to interact with the site.

See iNat API Reference: http://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference

This program is in the early stages of development and serves as a rudimentary proof of concept.
